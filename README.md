Neural Networks Applications for Control Systems

Bunch of command line utilities (both controlled by command line options and text configuration files)
with Tcl/Tk GUI which calls for command line tools to make a pretty user experience.
It's cross platform in general: both Win32 and Linux are supported.
The main purpose for command line utilities were research works performed during PhD thesis and articles
preparation (2001-2012).  GUI appeared when some developed functions were passed to students to investigate
NN approach in automatic control systems (2012-2013).
Now some features to provide non-linear and MIMO systems modelling and control are under development.
